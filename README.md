# OPC UA Information Model for Energy-Flexible Aqueous Parts Cleaning Machines


## Abstract

To reduce global greenhouse gases, renewable energies are being integrated
into power grids worldwide, but their inherent volatility leads to overproduc-
tion or underproduction of electricity. Besides using costly electrical storage,
supply and demand can be synchronized using energy-flexibility.

Industrial aqueous parts cleaning machines have significant potential for
energy-flexible operation. VDI 5207 suggests various energy-flexibility mea-
sures, such as utilizing the inherent storage capacities of rinsing tanks.

This paper introduces an energy synchronization platform and an OPC UA
interface for operating machines in an energy-flexible manner. It combines data
on composition and electricity prices to generate flexibility measures. A central
OPC UA server communicates with the market platform and distributes these
measures to machine-specific servers, automating the machine's operation and
documenting energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The concept is tested on
the BvL YukonDAD cleaning machine at the ETA factory of TU Darmstadt.
